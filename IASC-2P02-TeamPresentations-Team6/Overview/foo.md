StoryMapJS
Project introduction/overview: 



What are the main goals of StoryMapJS?

StoryMap is a free online storytelling tool used for mapping and locating a story’s main events. 
“StoryMapJS is a free tool to help you tell stories on the web that highlight the locations of a series of events. It is a new tool, yet stable in our development environment, and it has a friendly authoring tool.” (Knight Lab, 2018)

What argument does StoryMapJS make? 

StoryMapJS is a mapping environment.

What are the main features? Give us an overview of available features and show us how to use the tool.

“There are a couple ways you can make a Story Map.” (Knight Lab, 2018)

Maps - “Add a slide for each place in your story. Setting the location is as easy as a text search for the name, address, or latitude and longitude. You can change the visual style of your map with a few presets, or you can use Mapbox to create your own style.” (Knight Lab, 2018)

Really big images - “You can tell stories with large photographs, works of art, historic maps, and other image files. Because it works best with pixel-dense files, we call these gigapixel. Setting one up requires you to host files on a web server.” (Knight Lab, 2018)

Media sources - “StoryMapJS can pull in media from a variety of sources. Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Dailymotion, Google Maps, Wikipedia, SoundCloud, Document Cloud and more!” (Knight Lab, 2018)

Where is StoryMapJS located?
