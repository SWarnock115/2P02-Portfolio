## About Me


//

Hi and welcome to my Blog.
My name is Sydnee Warnock and I am a fourth year Brock student hoping to complete a major in Interactive Arts and Science, or IASC for short. I hope to gain a collection of unique skills that will help me better understand digital humanities and further my knowledge in it. My research focus is media archaeology and how it relates to old and obsolete game systems. I want to learn how this old tech has influenced today's trends, some alternative paths game systems could have taken, as well as how some of the old tech is being riased from the grave to experience a new life. This focus can be seen in my featured project, which focuses on the failed game system Virtual Boy, which was released by Nintendo in 1995. In the presentation I discussed its shortlived history, its development, and the struggles it faced. I also looked at how it relates to zombie tech, alternative history as well as the idea of zxombie tech as it relates to the Virtual Boy. In the future I hope to use this knowledge to further my career with the knowledge of past trends and hope to predict future trends to ensure success.
